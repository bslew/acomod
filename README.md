# ACOustic RESonance package

This package provides a module and a viewer program to trace resonance frequencies of excited bodies.

For example, it can be used to measure length of an excited metal bar, or to help identify resonance frequencies
and corresponding length scales of mechanical components (e.g. in a running car with depending on speed)
or to test 1/f noise and microphonic effects in electrical devices the program runs on.
