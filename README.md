# ACOustic MODes Viewer

This program is a simple viewer of power spectral density of sound. 
The package provides a module and a program to trace Fourier acoustic modes and resonance frequencies of excited bodies.

## Use cases
For example you can:
* estimate length of an excited metal bar, guitar string, or 
* measure frequency of flute tones, 
* identify resonance frequencies and through provided sound wave propagation velocity the corresponding length scales of mechanical components that generate unwanted resonances (e.g. in a car as a function of speed)
* test 1/f noise and microphonic effects in electrical devices the program runs on.


## Features
* Records sound from microphone or sound file (e.g. wav format)
* Shows trace of maximal peaks 


### Features that will be implemented 
* Save recorded and processed data to files for further analysis (not implemented yet)
* Save animations of PSD response for video files (not implemented yet)

## Installation
`pip install --index-url=https://test-pypi.org/simple acomod`
